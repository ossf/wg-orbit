# ORBIT: Open Resources for Baselines, Interoperability, and Tooling

The ORBIT Working Group (WG) is a [Sandbox-level](https://github.com/ossf/tac/blob/main/process/working-group-lifecycle.md#to-become-sandbox) group within the [Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF)](https://openssf.org).

ORBIT exists to develop and maintain interoperable resources for the identification and presentation of security-relevant data.
It provides a home for collaborative activities, best practice definitions, documentation, testing, integration, and other artifacts supporting the mission.

The group is open to participation from anyone who abides by the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct 2.0](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct/) (OpenSSF member or not).
